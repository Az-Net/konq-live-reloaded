     * @brief Improve drag and drop functionality provided by `QWebEngineView`
     *
     * Before Qt 5.15.5, `QWebEngineView` didn't allow to open remote URLs by drag and drop. This function, together with
     * dragEnterEvent(), dragMoveEvent() and m_dragAndDropHandledBySuperclass allow that.
     *
     * In Qt 5.15.5, `QWebEngineView` allows opening remote URLs by drag and drop, but forces doing so in a new tab.
     * This reimplemented method, instead, opens it in the current view.
     *
     * @note Implementing this function with the behavior of `QWebEngineView` from Qt 5.15.5 is impossible without resorting
     * to an ugly hack. The problem is that we can't know whether the dropped URL should actually be opened or not because there
     * can be pages (or part of them) where dropping an URL has a special meaning (for example, uploading a file). In this case,
     * this function shouldn't interfere with the base class implementation. Unfortunately, `QWebEngineView` doesn't provide any
     * way to find out whether the URL should be opened or if the drop had
     * another effect, so we always should rely only on the base class implementation, which isn't configurable. To trick it,
     * we use WebEnginePage::setDropOperationStarted() to tell the page that a drop operation has started: this changes the way
     * WebEnginePage::createWindow() works so that it returns the page itself rather than creating a new page. The main problem,
     * however, is that there's no way to find out when the drop operation has ended, so we have to resort to a crude heuristic
     * to decide when this happens (as described in WebEnginePage::setDropOperationStarted())
