This is a fork of KDE Konqueror intended to be upgraded and improved for future-proof web browsing and file manipulation.   

Initial release  
October 23, 2000  

Konqueror is a free and open-source browser and manager that provides web access and file-viewer functionality for systems (such as local files, files on a remote FTP server and files in a disk image).  
It forms a core part of the KDE Software Compilation.  
Developed by volunteers, Konqueror can run on most Unix-like operating systems.  
The KDE community licenses and distributes Konqueror under GNU GPL-2.0-or-later.  

Konqueror can utilize all KIOslaves installed on the user's system. Some examples include:
* FTP and SFTP/SSH browser
* Samba (Microsoft file-sharing) browser
* HTTP browser
* IMAP mail client
* ISO (CD image) viewer
* VNC viewer  
A complete list is available in the KDE Info Center's Protocols section.

Intended Upgrades:  
* Add Web Serial API Support
* Add WebExtensions API Support
* Add Simple Markdown Editor
* Add Matrix Viewer & Manipulator
* Add Color Syntax to Hexadecimal in Files
* Add Unique Icons for All Common File Types
* Set All File Types to Appropriately Open in New Tabs
